# Getting Started

This repo is to help newbies get started with open source. The objective of this tutorial is to make your first Pull Request and add your name to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. If you get stuck, open an issue and ask your doubt.

## Setting up softwares

To work on Github hosted projects, one has to use Git - a Version Control System. So the first task is to install git on your machine. For Windows users, download git from here - https://git-scm.com/downloads. For Linux users, you can use your distro's package manager to install git.

**Note:** Although Linux isn't mandatory, it is preferred while working with Open Source Software.

**Note:** You can learn about Version Control Systems (VCS) [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control).

### Setting up git

After installing git, run git and execute these commands:

```
git config --global user.name "[name]"
git config --global user.email "[email address]"
```

That should complete the software setup.
